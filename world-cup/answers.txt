Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With a small number of simulations... chance of winning cant be 0.0%

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000 because the difference becomes < 1%
